## Welcome
Hi! I'm luklabuz and I'm a student of the AGH University of Science and Technology in Poland. I started using [GitHub](github.com) as a part of a course.

I **don't** have _that_ much to say, so a pic of a cat will have to do:

## My projects

I currently work with the [mnkl group](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne-2021-2022/mknl) on a chess engine as our university assignment. Due to time constraints, we weren't able to finish the engine on time, altough we managed to create a working CLI interface with algebraic notation input and semigraphical output, alongside a rudimentary game logger service. We sadly failed to implement a fully graphical environemnt and the actual engine is also unfinished, so only PVP mode is currently supported.
